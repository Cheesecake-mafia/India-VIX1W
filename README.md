# India-VIX1W
I have used the white papers available on the NSE India and CBOE websites to generate the volatility index aka VIX on weekly options rather than the normal methodology of doing it on monthly options. This is just a research project that I made on a long holiday and may have some bugs in it. 

I am not a programmer per say and would really appreciate if you could make the code more efficient and cleaner. 

Next, I am planning on using a database and the python library of streamlit to make a dashboard to give a realtime update and maybe try to see if some repeatable patterns emerge and maybe use the divergence between India VIX and VIX1W to generate some alpha.
